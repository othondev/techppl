### Questions

- You have a new requirement to implement for your application: its logic should stay exactly the same but it will need to have a different user interface (e.g. if you wrote a web app, a different UI may be a REPL). Please describe how you would go about implementing this new UI in your application? Would you need to restructure your solution in any way?
- You now need to make your application “production ready”, and deploy it so that it can be used by customers. Please describe the steps you’d need to take for this to happen.
- What did you think about this coding test - is there anything you’d suggest in order to improve it?
